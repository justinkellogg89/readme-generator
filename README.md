npm install dotenv
npm install inquirer

## Technologies Used

Javascript, NodeJS, Axios, DotENV, Inquirer.

## Usage

Upon opening the index.js file, the user should run npm i in their terminal in order to install all of the dependencies for this project. Upon completion, the user can type "node index.js" into their terminal where they will be asked a series of questions. Upon completion of answering the questions, this project will generate a readme.md file in the same directory as where the file was run.

The readme covers the basics of having a README file with any project. This includes the name of the project, a description of said project, the technologies used, what dependencies need to be installed, what the project is for, the status of the project with the selections of completed, active, and inactive, a choice of various licenses, contribution instructions, and tests that can be run on the code.

## Project Status

This project is near completed. The only outlier is pulling the github profile picture and email address into the readme file.
